### Hi there 👋 I'm Jaime Bisuña
#### I do Software Development and UI/UX Design with Figma

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a System Defect Tracker using Spring Boot
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java, Design Patterns, OOP, and many more
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with understanding some of the deeper concepts of React (e.g. Hooks, Functional vs Class Components, etc.)
- ⚡ Fun fact: I love baking bread 🍞 on my free time, kneading sure does take away stress
